Consider a "word" as any sequence of capital letters A-Z (not limited to just "dictionary words"). For any word with at least two different letters, there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different order (for instance, STATIONARILY/ANTIROYALIST, which happen to both be dictionary words; for our purposes "AAIILNORSTTY" is also a "word" composed of the same letters as these two).
We can then assign a number to every word, based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all words made up of the same set of letters.

Sample words, with their rank:
1) ABAB = 2
2) AAAB = 1
3) BAAA = 4
4) QUESTION = 24572
5) BOOKKEEPER = 10743
6) NONINTUITIVENESS = 8222334634
